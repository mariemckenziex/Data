## Projects
#### Credit Card Customer Data Analysis
##### Code:
[Credit Card Customer Data Analysis](https://github.com/mariemckenziex/Data/blob/main/CreditCardDatAnalysis.ipynb)

##### Project Goals:
The primary goals of this project are to thoroughly understand customer spending behavior by identifying key patterns and relationships within the dataset, improve data quality through comprehensive cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accurate analysis, determine the significant factors influencing spending amounts across various categories such as card type, expense type, and time, create insightful visualizations that effectively communicate spending trends, and ultimately deliver actionable insights that can inform strategic business decisions related to customer spending.

##### Skills:
A. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
- Handling missing values (imputation, deletion)
- Duplicate removal
- Data type conversion
- Text standardization
- Outlier detection and removal (IQR)
  
B. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Calculating summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
- Data aggregation and grouping
- Data ordering

C. Data Visualization:
- Creating histograms, time series plots, and bar charts using libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Interpreting and communicating insights from visualizations

D. Statistical Analysis:
- Basic understanding of mean, median, standard deviation, and data distributions

E. Programming:
- Proficiency in Python and pandas for data manipulation

##### Technologies:
Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

##### Findings:
1. Overall spending patterns indicate a concentration of spending frequency within the 831-941 range. This suggests a common spending level or bracket among the observed transactions. A spending figure of $350,000 is the least recurring, implying a very high-value but rare transaction.

2. Spending changes over time presents a volatile spending pattern over approximately a year and a half, from November 2013 to May 2015, with spending amounts fluctuating significantly between roughly $100,000 and $250,000. While a central tendency appears around the $150,000 to $175,000 range, the data exhibits frequent peaks and troughs, suggesting an unstable spending behavior rather than a consistent upward or downward trend.

3. Spending based on card type exhibits a close range, with Platinum cardholders demonstrating the highest average spend at $157,493.83, followed closely by Signature at $157,133.72, then Silver at $156,371.03, and Gold with the lowest average spend at $154,631.62. Spending behavior doesn't significantly vary among these card types.

4. Spending across different expense categories illustrates the average distribution across six distinct expense types: Bills, Entertainment, Food, Fuel, Grocery, and Travel. Notably, the "Bills" category exhibits the highest mean spending. Travel" displays the lowest indicating potential areas for budget analysis and financial planning
The remaining categories, Entertainment, Food, Fuel, and Grocery, show intermediate spending levels, falling between these two extremes

##### Project Goals:
The primary goal of this project is to conduct an initial exploration and cleaning of the Walmart stock price dataset, importing the data into R, previewing its structure, examining column data types, and addressing data quality issues, missing values, duplicates, and leading/trailing spaces. The project aims to perform an analysis of trading by calculating total volume and visualizing the yearly trend of average daily volume, as well as identifying the daily highest opening and lowest closing prices.
